This folder contains the stable version of the game.

Every week (as soon as the production phase has started) you should merge the changes from the dev branch to this branch, make a build from this version and upload it to itch.io

We do this from a separate branch to
* make sure it contains only files that exist on the source control system without any local changes
* have a stable version of the game at all times. When an investor comes by and wants to see the latest version, you can always fallback to this version in case dev is unstable.
