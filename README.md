# WickedWarehouse
In this project I worked together with 4 of my fellow students to create a game from scratch in Unity. We ended up reaching 3rd place overall among 28 entries for this semester and it was a project I was really proud of.

The code of this project previously existed on a different source control system which is why this is only the first push.
