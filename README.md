# WickedWarehouse
In this project I worked together with 4 of my fellow students to create a game from scratch in Unity. We ended up reaching 3rd place overall among 28 entries for this semester and it was a project I was really proud of.

The code of this project previously existed on a different source control system which is why this is only the first push, if you'd like to see more info and actually play the build you can click the link here: https://itch.io/jam/dae-game-projects-2022/rate/1401094
